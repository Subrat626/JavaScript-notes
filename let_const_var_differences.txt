the differences between var, let, and const based on your examples:

1. Scope:
var has functional scope.
let and const have block scope.

var a = 10;

function test() {
    var a = 20;
    console.log(a);
}

console.log(a); // Output: 10
test();         // Output: 20

2. Block Scope:
var ignores block scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
let and const respect block scope.

// var
var b = 20;
{
    var b = 40;
}
console.log(b); // Output: 40

// let
let b = 20;
{
    let b = 40;
    console.log(b); // Output: 40
}
console.log(b); // Output: 20

// const
const b = 20;
{
    const b = 40;
    console.log(b); // Output: 40
}
console.log(b); // Output: 20

3. Variable Declaration and Reassignment:

var can be re-declared and re-assigned.
let can be re-assigned but not re-declared.
const cannot be re-declared or re-assigned.

// var
var c = 40;
var c = 50;
c = 60;
var c = 80;
console.log(c); // Output: 80

// let
let c = 10;
c = 40;
console.log(c); // Output: 40

// const
const d = 30;
// const d = 40; // Error: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
// d = 50;      // Error: Assignment to constant variable

4. Hoisting:
Both var, let, and const are hoisted, but with differences.

console.log(abcd); // Output: undefined
var abcd = 10;

// console.log(deadVariable); // Error: Cannot access 'deadVariable' before initialization
// let deadVariable = 10;
// const abcd = 10;

Note: var is hoisted and initialized with undefined. However, using let or const in the same situation results in a ReferenceError due to the temporal dead zone.

The temporal dead zone is the time gap between variable declaration and variable initialization in let and const.
